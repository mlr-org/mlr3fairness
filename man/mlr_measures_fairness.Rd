\section{Predefined measures}{

\CRANpkg{mlr3fairness} comes with a set of predefined fairness measures as listed below.
For full flexibility, \link{MeasureFairness} can be used to construct classical
group fairness measures based on a difference between a performance metrics across groups
by combining a performance measure with an operation for measuring differences.
Furthermore \link{MeasureSubgroup} can be used to measure performance in a given subgroup, or alternatively
ggroupwise_metrics(measure, task) to instantiate a measure for each subgroup in a \link{Task}.
