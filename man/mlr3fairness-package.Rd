\title{mlr3fairness: Fairness Auditing and Debiasing for 'mlr3'}
\description{
Integrates fairness auditing and bias mitigation methods for the 'mlr3' ecosystem. This includes fairness metrics, reporting tools, visualizations and bias mitigation techniques such as "Reweighing" described in 'Kamiran, Calders' (2012) <doi:10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8> and "Equalized Odds" described in 'Hardt et al.' (2016) <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6374-interaction-screening-efficient-and-sample-optimal-learning-of-ising-models.pdf">. Integration with 'mlr3' allows for auditing of ML models as well as convenient joint tuning of machine learning algorithms and debiasing methods.
