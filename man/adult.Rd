\description{
Dataset used to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
Also known as "Census Income" dataset
Train dataset contains 13 features and 30178 observations.
Test dataset contains 13 features and 15315 observations.
Target column is "target": A binary factor where 1: <=50K and 2: >50K for annual income.
The column \code{"sex"} is set as protected attribute.

\section{Using Adult - Known Problems}{

The adult dataset has several known limitations such as its age, limited documentation, and outdated feature encodings (Ding et al., 2021).
Furthermore, the selected threshold (income <=50K) has strong implications on the outcome of analysis, such that
"In many cases, the $50k threshold understates and misrepresents the broader picture" (Ding et al., 2021).
As a result, conclusions w.r.t. real-world implications are severely limited.

We decide to replicate the dataset here, as it is a widely used benchmark dataset and it can still serve this purpose.

\section{Pre-processing}{

\itemize{
\item \code{fnlwgt} Remove final weight, which is the number of people the census believes the entry represents
\item \code{native-country} Remove Native Country, which is the country of origin for an individual
\item Rows containing \code{NA} in workclass and occupation have been removed.
\item Pre-processing inspired by article: @url https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//classes/sp15/cse190-c/reports/sp15/048.pdf
