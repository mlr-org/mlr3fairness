# Introduction: Fairness Pipeline Operators

Given we detected some form of bias during bias auditing, we are often interested in obtaining fair(er) models.
There are several ways to achieve this, such as collecting additional data or finding and fixing errors in the data, but given there are no biases in the labelling process one other option is to debias models using either **preprocessing**, **postprocessing** and **inprocessing** methods.
`mlr3fairness` provides some operators as `PipeOp`s for `mlr3pipelines`.
If you are not familiar with [mlr3pipelines](), the [mlr3 book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/pipelines.html)

We again showcase debiasing using the `adult_train` task:
```{r}
library(mlr3fairness)
library(mlr3pipelines)
library(mlr3)

task = tsk("adult_train")
```

#  Reweighing algorithms

`mlr3fairness` implements 2 reweighing-based algorithms:
`reweighing_wts` and `reweighing_os`. `reweighing_wts` adds observation weights to a `Task` that can counteract imbalances between the conditional probabilities $P(Y | pta)$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(mlr3misc)
dt = as.data.table(mlr_pipeops)
knitr::kable(dt[map_lgl(dt$tags, function(x) "fairness" %in% x)][, c(1,7,8,9,10)])
```

We fist instantiate the `PipeOp`:

```{r}
p1 = po("reweighing_wts")
```

and directly add the weights:

```{r}
t1 = p1$train(list(task))[[1]]
```

Often we directly combine the `PipeOp` with a `Learner` to automate the preprocessing (see `learner_rw`). Below we instantiate a small benchmark

```{r}
set.seed(4321)
learner = lrn("classif.rpart", cp = 0.005)
learner_rw = as_learner(po("reweighing_wts") %>>% learner)
grd = benchmark_grid(list(task), list(learner, learner_rw), rsmp("cv", folds=3))
bmr = benchmark(grd)
```

We can now compute the metrics for our benchmark and see if reweighing actually improved fairness, measured
via True Positive Rate (TPR) and classification accuracy (ACC):

```{r}
bmr$aggregate(msrs(c("fairness.tpr", "fairness.acc")))
```
```{r}
fairness_accuracy_tradeoff(bmr, msr("fairness.tpr"))
```

Our model became way fairer wrt. TPR but minimally worse wrt. accuracy!
