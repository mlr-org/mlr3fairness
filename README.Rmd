## Why should I care about fairness in machine learning?

Machine Learning model predictions can be skewed by a range of factors and thus might be considered unfair towards certain groups or individuals.
An example would be the COMPAS algorithm, which is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendant’s
likelihood of reoffending (recidivism).
[Studies](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) have shown, that the algorithm might be biased in favor of white defendants.
Biases can occur in a large variety of situations where algorithms automate or support human decision making e.g. credit checks, automatic HR tools along with a variety of other domains.


The **goal of `mlr3fairness`** is to allow for auditing of `mlr3` learners, visualization and subsequently trying to improve fairness using debiasing strategies.

> :warning: **Note**
> Bias auditing and debiasing solely based on observational data **can not** guarantee fairness of a decision making system.
> Several biases, for example comming from the data can not be detected using the approaches implemented in `mlr3fairness`.
> This goal of this software is thus to allow for a better understanding and first hints at possible fairness problems in a
> studied model.


## Feature Overview

* [**Fairness Visualizations:**](#fairness-visualizations) Diagnose fairness problems through visualizations.

* [**Debiasing Methods:**](#debiasing-methods) Correct fairness problems in three lines of code.

* [**Fairness Report:**](#model-cards--datasheets) Obtain a report regarding an algorithm's fairness. (Under development)

### Protected Attribute

`mlr3fairness` requires information about the protected attribute wrt. which we want to assess fairness. This can be set via the `col_role` "pta" (protected attribute).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
task$col_roles$pta = "variable_name"
```

In case a non-categorical or more complex protected attribute is required, it can be manually computed and added to the task. `mlr3fairness` does not require specific types for `pta`, but will compute one metric for every unique value in the `pta` column.

### Fairness Metrics {#metrics}

`mlr3fairness` offers a variety of fairness metrics.
Metrics are prefixed with `fairness.` and can be found in the `msr()` dictionary.
Most fairness metrics are based on a difference between two protected groups (e.g. male and female) for a given metric (e.g. the false positive rate: `fpr`).
See [the vignette](https://textbook.coleridgeinitiative.org/chap-bias.html) for a more in-depth introduction to fairness metrics and how to choose them.

```{r}
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3fairness)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mlr3fairness:::mlr_measures_fairness)
```

Additional **custom fairness metrics** can be easily constructed, [the vignette](https://textbook.coleridgeinitiative.org/chap-bias.html) contains more details.
The `fairness_tensor()` function can be used with a `Prediction` in order to print group-wise confusion matrices for each protected attribute group.
We can furthermore measure fairrness in each group separately using `MeasureSubgroup` and `groupwise_metrics`.

### Fairness Visualizations {#viz}

Visualizations can be used with either a `Prediction`, `ResampleResult` or a `BenchmarkResult`.
For more information regarding those objects, refer to the [mlr3 book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/basics.html).


- **fairness_accuracy_tradeoff**: Plot available trade-offs between fairness and model performance.

- **compare_metrics**: Compare fairness across models and cross-validation folds.

- **fairness_prediction_density**: Density plots for each protected attribute.


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12}
library(mlr3learners)
t = tsk("adult_train")$filter(1:5000)
design = benchmark_grid(
  tasks = t,
  learners = lrns(c("classif.ranger", "classif.rpart"), predict_type = "prob"),
  resamplings = rsmps("cv", folds = 3)
)

bmr = benchmark(design)

library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
p1 = fairness_accuracy_tradeoff(bmr, msr("fairness.fpr")) + ggtitle("fairness_accuracy_tradeoff")
p2 = compare_metrics(bmr, msrs(c("fairness.fpr", "fairness.tpr"))) + ggtitle("compare_metrics")
p3 = fairness_prediction_density(bmr) + ggtitle("fairness_prediction_density")
p1 / (p2 | p3)
```

### Debiasing Methods {#debiasing}

Debiasing methods can be used to improve the fairness of a given model.
`mlr3fairness` includes several methods that can be used together with
`mlr3pipelines` to obtain fair(er) models:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(mlr3pipelines)
lrn = as_learner(po("reweighing_wts") %>>% lrn("classif.rpart"))
rs = resample(lrn, task = tsk("compas")$filter(1:500), rsmp("cv"))
rs$score(msr("fairness.acc"))
```

**Overview:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(mlr3misc)
library(mlr3pipelines)
dt = as.data.table(mlr_pipeops)
knitr::kable(dt[map_lgl(dt$tags, function(x) "fairness" %in% x)][, c(1,7,8,9,10)])
```

### Fair Learners

`mlr3fairness` furthermore contains several learners that can be used to directly learn fair models:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tab = mlr_learners_fairness
knitr::kable(tab)
```

### Datasets

`mlr3fairness` includes two fairness datasets: `adult` and `compas`.
See `?adult` and `?compas` for additional information regarding columns.

You can load them using `tsk(<key>)`.

### Model Cards & Datasheets

An important step towards achieving more equitable outcomes for ML models is adequate documentation
for datasets and models in machine learning. `mlr3fairness` comes with reporting aides for `models`
and `datasets`. This provides empty templates that can be used to create interactive reports through
`RMarkdown`.


| Report             |  Description             | Reference                   | Example                                                                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `report_modelcard` | Modelcard for ML models  | Mitchell et al., 2018       | {link](https://mlr3fairness.mlr-org.com/articles/modelcard/modelcard.html) |
| `report_datasheet` | Datasheet for data sets  | Gebru et al., 2018          | [link](https://mlr3fairness.mlr-org.com/articles/datasheet/datasheet.html) |
| `report_fairness`  | Fairness Report          | -[^1]                      | [link](https://mlr3fairness.mlr-org.com/articles/fairness/fairness.html)   |

**Usage:**

The `report_*` functions instantiate a new `.Rmd` template that contains a set of pre-defined 
questions which can be used for reporting as well as initial graphics.
The goal is that a user extends this `.Rmd` file to create comprehensive documentation for 
datasets, ML models or to document a model's fairness.
It can later be converted into a `html` report using`rmarkdown`'s `render`.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
rmdfile = report_datasheet()
rmarkdown::render(rmdfile)
```


### Demo for Adult Dataset

We provide a short example detailing how `mlr3fairness` integrates with the `mlr3` ecosystem.

```r
library(mlr3fairness)

#Initialize Fairness Measure
fairness_measure = msr("fairness.fpr")
#Initialize tasks
task_train = tsk("adult_train")
task_test = tsk("adult_test")
#Initialize model
learner = lrn("classif.rpart", predict_type = "prob")

#Verify fairness metrics
learner$train(task_train)
predictions = learner$predict(task_test)
predictions$score(fairness_measure, task = task_test)

#Visualize the predicted probability score based on protected attribute.
fairness_prediction_density(predictions, task_test)
```

### Extensions

- The [mcboost](https://github.com/mlr-org/mcboost) package integrates with **mlr3** and offers
  additional debiasing post-processing functionality for **classification**, **regression** and **survival**.
