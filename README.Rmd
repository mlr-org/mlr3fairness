# Installation

Install the development version from mlr3 repo

```r
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/mlr3fairness")
```

# Why should I care about fairness in machine learning?

Machine Learning model predictions can be skewed by a range of factors and thus might be considered unfair towards certain groups or individuals.
An example would be the COMPAS algorithm, which is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendant’s
likelihood of reoffending (recidivism).
[Studies](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) have shown, that the algorithm might be biased in favor of white defendants.
Biases can occur in a large variety of situations where algorithms automate or support human decision making e.g. credit checks, automatic HR tools along with a variety of other domains.


The **goal of `mlr3fairness`** is to allow for auditing of `mlr3` learners, visualization and subsequently trying to improve fairness using debiasing strategies.


## Feature Overview

* **Fairness Measures:** Audit algorithmms for fairness using a variety of fairness criteria. This also allows for designing custom criteria.
* **Fairness Visualizations:** Diagnose fairness problems through visualizations.
* **Debiasing Methods:** Correct fairness problems in three lines of code.
* **Fairness Report:** Obtain a report regarding an algorithm's fairness. (Under development)




### Fairness Measures

`mlr3fairness` offers a variety of fairness metrics.
Metrics are prefixed with `fairness.` and can be found in the `msr()` dictionary.
Most fairness metrics are based on a difference between two protected groups (e.g. male and female) for a given metric (e.g. the false positive rate: `fpr`).

```{r}
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3fairness)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mlr3fairness:::mlr_measures_fairness)
```

### Fairness Visualizations

Visualizations can be used with either a `Prediction`, `ResampleResult` or a `BenchmarkResult`.
For more information regarding those objects, refer to the [mlr3 book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/basics.html).


- **fairness_accuracy_tradeoff**: Plot available trade-offs between fairness and model performance.

- **compare_metrics**: Compare fairness across models and cross-validation forlds.

- **fairness_prediction_density**: Density plots for each protected attribute.


### Debiasing Methods

Debiasing methods can be used to improve the fairness of a given model.
`mlr3fairness` includes several methods that can be used together with
`mlr3pipelines` to obtain fair(er) models:


```{r}
library(mlr3pipelines)
lrn = as_learner(po("reweighing_wts") %>>% lrn("classif.rpart"))
rs = resample(lrn, task = tsk("compas")$filter(1:500), rsmp("cv"))
rs$score(msr("fairness.acc"))
```

### Datasets

`mlr3fairness` includes two fairness datasets: `adult` and `compas`. See `?adult` and `?compas` for additional information regarding columns.

You can load them using `tsk(<key>)`.

## Demo for Adult Dataset

We provide a short example detailing how `mlr3fairness` integrates with the `mlr3` ecosystem.


```r
library(mlr3fairness)

#Initialize Fairness Measure
fairness_measure = msr("fairness.fpr")
#Initialize tasks
task_train = tsk("adult_train")
task_test = tsk("adult_test")
#Initialize model
learner = lrn("classif.rpart", predict_type = "prob")

#Verify fairness metrics
learner$train(task_train)
predictions = learner$predict(task_test)
predictions$score(fairness_measure, task = task_test)

#Visualize the predicted probability score based on protected attribute.
fairness_prediction_density(predictions, task_test)
```

# Near-Future Plans

## Visualizations
1. Should we add support to BenchmarkResult and Resampling result to fairness_prediction_density visulization, and how does it look like.
2. Improvement on visualizations, like anchor points and others. See issues.
3. More visualizations.


## Metrics
1. Add support to non-binary target attributes and non-binary protected attributes.
2. Add metrics that are not supported with current design in `extra_measures.R`.

## Debiasing Methods
1. More Debiasing Methods, post-processing and in-processing.


# Bugs, Feedbacks and Questions

mlr3fairnessWASCS is a free and open source software project that encourages participation and feedback. If you have any issues, questions, suggestions or feedback, please do not hesitate to open an “issue” about it on the GitHub page!

In case of problems / bugs, it is often helpful if you provide a “minimum working example” that showcases the behaviour (but don’t worry about this if the bug is obvious).
