#' @description
#' Dataset used to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
#' Also known as "Census Income" dataset
#' Train dataset contains 13 features and 30178 observations.
#' Test dataset contains 13 features and 15315 observations.
#' Target column is "target": A binary factor where 1: <=50K and 2: >50K for annual income.
#' The column `"sex"` is set as protected attribute.
#'
#' @section Pre-processing:
#' * `fnlwgt` Remove final weight, which is the number of people the census believes the entry represents
#' * `native-country` Remove Native Country, which is the country of origin for an individual
#' * Rows containing `NA` in workclass and occupation have been removed.
#' * Pre-processing inspired by article: @url https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//classes/sp15/cse190-c/reports/sp15/048.pdf
