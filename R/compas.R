#' @title COMPAS Dataset

#' @name compas
#' @aliases Compas

#' @description
#' The COMPAS dataset includes the processed COMPAS data between 2013-2014.
#' The data cleaning process followed the guidance in the original COMPAS repo.
#' Contains 6172 observations and 14 features.
#' The target column could either be "is_recid" or "two_year_recid", but often "two_year_recid" is prefered.
#' The column `"sex"` is set as protected attribute, but more often `"race"` is used.
#' 
#' @section Using COMPAS - Known Problems:
#' The COMPAS dataset was collected as part of the ProPublica analysis of machine bias in criminal sentencing.
#' It is important to note, that using COMPAS is generally discouraged for the following reasons:
#' * The prediction task derived from this dataset has little connection to actually relevant tasks in the
#'   context of risk assessment instruments.
#' * Collected data and labels suffer from disparate measurement bias.
#'
#' For a more in-depth treatment, see Bao et al., 2021: It's COMPASlicated: The Messy Relationship between RAI Datasets and Algorithmic Fairness Benchmarks.
#' We replicate the dataset here to raise awareness for this issue.
#' Furthermore, similar issues exist across a wide variety of datasets widely used in the context of fairness auditing
#' and we therefore consider issues, e.g. derived from disparate measurement bias an important issue in the context of fairness audits.
#'
#' @section Pre-processing:
#' * Identifying columns are removed
#' * Removed the outliers for abs(days_b_screening_arrest) >= 30.
#' * Removed observations where is_recid != -1.
#' * Removed observations where c_charge_degree != "O".
#' * Removed observations where score_text != 'N/A'.
#' * Factorize the features that are categorical.
#' * Add length of stay (c_jail_out - c_jail_in) in the dataset.

#'
#' @section Metadata:
#' * (integer) age : The age of defendants.
#' * (factor) c_charge_degree : The charge degree of defendants. F: Felony M: Misdemeanor
#' * (factor) race: The race of defendants.
#' * (factor) age_cat: The age category of defendants.
#' * (factor) score_text: The score category of defendants.
#' * (factor) sex: The sex of defendants.
#' * (integer) priors_count: The prior criminal records of defendants.
#' * (integer) days_b_screening_arrest: The count of days between screening date and (original) arrest date.
#'   If they are too far apart, that may indicate an error. If the value is negative,
#'   that indicate the screening date happened before the arrest date.
#' * (integer) decile_score: Indicate the risk of recidivism (Min=1, Max=10)
#' * (integer) is_recid: Binary variable indicate whether defendant is rearrested at any time.
#' * (factor) two_year_recid: Binary variable indicate whether defendant is rearrested at within two years.
#' * (numeric) length_of_stay: The count of days stay in jail.
