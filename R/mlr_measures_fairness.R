#' @section Predefined measures:
#' \CRANpkg{mlr3fairness} comes with a set of predefined fairness measures as listed below.
#' For full flexibility, [MeasureFairness] can be used to construct classical
#' group fairness measures based on a difference between a performance metrics across groups
#' by combining a performance measure with an operation for measuring differences.
#' Furthermore [MeasureSubgroup] can be used to measure performance in a given subgroup, or alternatively
#' ggroupwise_metrics(measure, task) to instantiate a measure for each subgroup in a [Task].
