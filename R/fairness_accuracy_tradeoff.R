#' Plot Fairness Accuracy Trade-offs
#'
#' @description
#' Provides visualization wrt. trade-offs between fairness and accuracy metrics across learners and
#' resampling iterations.
#' This can assist in gauging the optimal model from a set of options along with estimates of variance
#' (through individual resampling iterations).
#'
#'
#' @param object ([PredictionClassif] | [BenchmarkResult] | [ResampleResult])\cr
#'   The binary class prediction object that will be evaluated.
#'   * If provided a [PredictionClassif].
#'     Then only one point will indicate the accuracy and fairness metrics for the current predictions.
#'     Requires also passing a [Task].
#'   * If provided a [ResampleResult].
#'     Then the plot will compare the accuracy and fairness metrics for the same model,
#'     but different resampling iterations  as well as the aggregate indicated by a cross.
#'   * If provided a [BenchmarkResult].
#'     Then the plot will compare the accuracy and fairness metrics for all models and all resampling iterations.
#'     Points are coloured according to the learner_id and faceted by task_id.
#'     The aggregated score is indicated by a cross.
#'
#' @param ...
#'   Arguments to be passed to methods. Such as:
#'   * `fairness_measure` ([Measure])\cr
#'     The fairness measures that will evaluated.
#'     Default measure set to be `msr("fairness.fpr")`
#'   * `accuracy_measure` ([Measure])\cr
#'     The accuracy measure that will evaluated.
#'     Default measure set to be [msr("classif.acc")][mlr3::MeasureClassif].
#'   * `task` ([TaskClassif])\cr
#'     The data task that contains the protected column, only required when the class of object is ([PredictionClassif])
