## Audit Report: Summary

This document introduces on how to use `mlr3fairness` to create audit reports with different tasks throughout the fairness exploration process.

There are three main sections for this document. Which describe the details for the task, the model and the interpretability of the parameters.

- [Task details](#task-details)
- [Model details](#model-details)
- [Interpretability](#Interpretability)

## Task details

In this fairness report, we investigate the fairness of the following task:

```{r}
task
```

### The General Task Documentation for the task:

Here we could get the basic details for the task.

```{r}
general_summary(task) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```
### Exploratory Data Analysis: 

We could also report the number of missing values, types and the levels for each feature:

```{r}
df_summary = data.frame(task$col_info)[task$col_info$id != "..row_id",
                                       !(names(task$col_info) %in% c("id", "label"))]
data.frame("Count_of_Missing_Value" = task$missings()) %>%
  cbind(df_summary) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

We first look at the label distribution:

```{r}
autoplot(task) + facet_wrap(task$col_roles$pta)
```

## Model details

We could see the model that has been used in `resample_result`:

```{r}
resample_result$learner
```

### Fairness Metrics

We could report more than one fairness metric, but keep in mind. Below the metrics are the mean of all the resample results.

```{r}
fair_metrics = msrs(c("fairness.acc","fairness.eod","fairness.fnr",
  "fairness.fpr","fairness.npv","fairness.ppv","fairness.tnr",
  "fairness.tpr"))
```

```{r}
resample_result$aggregate(fair_metrics) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

We could also use visualization to report the fairness.
For example, the fairness and accuracy trade off, compare metrics visualization and the fairness prediction density of the model `classif.rpart` .
For more detailed usage and examples, you may want to check the visualization vignette.

```{r}
fairness_accuracy_tradeoff(resample_result, msr("fairness.fnr"))
```

```{r, eval = (resample_result$learner$predict_type == "prob")}
fairness_prediction_density(resample_result)
```

```{r}
compare_metrics(resample_result, fair_metrics)
```

## Interpretability

Finally, we could use the external package to analyze the interpretability of the parameters. For the following example we choose `iml` as a demonstration. We need first extract the learner from `resample_result` and retrain it.

You could generate the variable importance plot like this

```{r}
library("iml")

target = task$target_names
learner = resample_result$learner
learner$train(task)

model = Predictor$new(model = learner,
                      data = task$data()[,.SD, .SDcols = !target],
                      y = task$data()[, ..target])

imp <- FeatureImp$new(model, loss = "ce")
plot(imp)
```

Or generate the feature effectness plot use the following code:

```{r, warning = F}
effect = FeatureEffects$new(model, method = "pdp")
effect$plot(features = c("age", "c_charge_degree"))
```

For more details of interpretability, you might want to check the documentation of `iml`.
