Description: Integrates fairness auditing and bias mitigation methods for
    the 'mlr3' ecosystem.  This includes fairness metrics, reporting
    tools, visualizations and bias mitigation techniques such as
    "Reweighing" described in 'Kamiran, Calders' (2012)
    <doi:10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8> and "Equalized Odds" described in
    'Hardt et al.' (2016)
    <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/file/9d2682367c3935defcb1f9e247a97c0d-Paper.pdf>.
    Integration with 'mlr3' allows for auditing of ML models as well as
    convenient joint tuning of machine learning algorithms and debiasing
    methods.
