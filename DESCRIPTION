Description:
    Integrates fairness auditing and bias mitigation methods for the 'mlr3' ecosystem.
    This includes fairness metrics, reporting tools, visualizations and bias mitigation techniques such as 
    "Reweighing" described in 'Kamiran, Calders' (2012) <doi:10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8>  and 
    "Equalized Odds" described in 'Hardt et al.' (2016) <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/file/9d2682367c3935defcb1f9e247a97c0d-Paper.pdf>.
    Integration with 'mlr3' allows for auditing of ML models as well as convenient joint tuning of
    machine learning algorithms and debiasing methods.
