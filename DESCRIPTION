Description:
    Integrates fairness auditing and debiasing methods into the mlr3 ecosystem.
    This includes fairness metrics, visualizations and debiasing methods such
    as Reweighing and Equalied Odds. Integration with mlr3 allows for auditing of mlr3 models as well as convenient joint tuning of ML algorithm and debiasing methods.
