Description:
    Integrates fairness auditing and debiasing methods into the 'mlr3' ecosystem.
    This includes fairness metrics, visualizations and debiasing methods such as 'Reweighing' and 'Equalized Odds'.
    Integration with mlr3 allows for auditing of mlr3 models as well as convenient joint tuning of
    machine learning algorithms and debiasing methods.
