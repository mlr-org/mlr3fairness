## Introduction

Introductory section which may include references in parentheses
[@R], or cite a reference such as @R in the text.


## Fairness in machine learning

Brief summary over the problem, citing some remarkable articles.


## Related work

I guess it is fine for this paper to restrict this to similar implementations, and to not give an overview of the literature.

\CRANpkg{fairness}, \CRANpkg{aif360}, Julia packages, ...

### The mlr3 ecosystem

\pkg{mlr3fairness} is tightly integrated into the ecosystem of packages around \CRANpkg{mlr3} [@mlr3].
Besides the infrastructure implemented in \pkg{mlr3} to fit, resample, or evaluate over 100 ML algorithms using a unified API,
extension packages bring numerous additional advantages:

* Flexible pre- and postprocessing via \CRANpkg{mlr3pipelines} [@mlr3pipelines].
* Support for survival analysis tasks via \CRANpkg{mlr3proba} [@mlr3proba].
* Extensive tuning capabilities via \CRANpkg{mlr3tuning}.
* Post-hoc analysis of benchmarked approaches via \CRANpkg{mlr3benchmark}.
* Connector to OpenML, an online scientific platform for collaborative ML [@Vanschoren2014], via \CRANpkg{mlr3oml}.

Some of these packages are showcased in the following [use case study](#usecase).


### Implemented functionality in mlr3fairness

The functionality is split into two tasks, namely detecting bias and debiasing.

#### Detecting bias
There are generally two approaches:

1. Quantifying bias via a performance metric, or
2. Visualizing bias.


#### Debiasing

Reweighting, ...


## Use case study {#usecase}
Maybe on adult or compas, or do we find something more exciting?

### The XXX task

### Detecting bias

### Correcting for bias
